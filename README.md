Final Fantasy XI Labeled Map Dats

## Description

No real version number, just up to date as of 9-25-24

### Private Servers
This seems to work fine with private servers to. Either backup your map DATs or use the Pivot plugin.

## Changes
This is compressed with 7zip. Uncompress using that and copy the ROM folders to your FFXI directory choosing yes when prompted to overwrite any files.
Make backups if you so choose, I'm not responsible for currupted dats.

#### Credit
I don't take credit for all these labeled maps. 
I've collected them all over the years and made some minor updates along the way. 
I zipped these up for a complete package and provided them to the community.
Credit goes to everyone aout there that help create these!
